# To-do-list Website

I made to-do-list website sample.

## What langugage did I use?

I used using ExpressJS(Javascript template) and MongoDb ( to store to-do-list text ) and Node Module ( Server-side). You can name anything for title.

Today instead Working as shown in photo. All you have to do is to change the word after '**localhost:3000/**'.
